This is like a passion project, I love F1 so I wanted to see how teams fair over the years anmd if the sport is getting faster and if the teams are getting faster.
In 2021 we saw the start of the finances limit but not the new regulations, so teams in 2021 saw a diffrence in 2020, 2022 new specs were added which made races tighter
This also saw the first fall of the dominant mercades who destryoed the last 7 years.

TODO

I need to be able to read the CSV files
I need to be able to use the RACEID numbers from races.csv to update the ids to names
I need to be able to extract all data from teams regardless of drivers
I need to be able to take that data and caluclate the pace, then COMAPRE to a previous or future year
2020 saw diffrent races? The calendar is not always the same. 
I would need a benchmark race, a race that all the teams share in all years, 2-3 would be good. 

STARTS FROM 2016
Focus on Teams and performance diffrences betweent 2-3 races
can change years
will account for the average pace of BOTH drivers.
can seperate to indivudal drivers (i.e Lando and Riccardo in 2021 vs 2022) Lando faster then riccard alot of the times :/ (except monza 2021 :D)
