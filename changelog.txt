This is like a passion project, I love F1 so I wanted to see how teams fair over the years anmd if the sport is getting faster and if the teams are getting faster.
In 2021 we saw the start of the finances limit but not the new regulations, so teams in 2021 saw a diffrence in 2020, 2022 new specs were added which made races tighter
This also saw the first fall of the dominant mercades who destryoed the last 7 years.

TODO

I need to be able to read the CSV files <- No Longer using CSV
I need to be able to use the RACEID numbers from races.csv (Update: Will now use API to find RACE ID not CSV file) to update the ids to names
I need to be able to extract all data from teams regardless of drivers <- Done
I need to be able to take that data and caluclate the pace, then COMAPRE to a previous or future year <- Create a Standard deviation 
(Take the average race time for that race and compare the teams 2020 and 2021 to both averages, depending on how much faster they are to the rest of the field)
2020 saw diffrent races? The calendar is not always the same. <- Wont matter we are comparing race by race for the years
I would need a benchmark race, a race that all the teams share in all years, 2-3 would be good. <- Wont be doing. Will be choisng one race to another

ChangeLog
1/24 I figured out how to splice the data, and have aquired the Q3 times of both drivers, now i just need
to multiply them by 60 and take the smallest number, make functions to do this!
