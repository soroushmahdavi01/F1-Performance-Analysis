# I want to create a program that allows peopel to see performance average increase between teams thorught the years
# Example Force India Racing point 2019/2020 increase dramticly between the two, count the first race and the last race or the average pace increases. 
# so 2019 their average pace was 1:19 for thes first race and 1:17 in the next years race for  opening so a 25% increase in pace, now we take that over 25 races and average the overall pace we would get 20 % increase,
